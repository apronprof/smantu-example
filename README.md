Routes are located in `config/urls.php`

By default the file with routes looks like this:

You can create new routes by using the methods `get()` and `post()` of the object `$router`. The method takes 2 parameters (route and controller).
route must look like this 'shop/items' without slashes at the start and the end of a string.

The second parameter have to look like 'name_of_the_controller@name_of_the_method'.

the third parameter is for middlewares 
[new \App\Middlewares\HttpMethodMiddleware(), ...]

In order to use parameters in url you need to use {} around the name of a parameter. (For example 'users/{id}'). The parameter will be in the array $parameters that will be given as the first parameter to your controller.

Use the method _404 to choose a controller and its method for handling unknown routes. It takes only one parameter that is controller.
